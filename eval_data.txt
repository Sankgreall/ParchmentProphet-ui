Water is a fundamental component of life, essential for maintaining overall health. It plays a critical role in regulating body temperature, transporting nutrients, and removing waste. Proper hydration is necessary for digestion, nutrient absorption, and overall bodily functions.

Dehydration can lead to various health issues, ranging from mild symptoms like headaches and fatigue to severe complications such as kidney stones and urinary tract infections. Adequate water intake is crucial for maintaining physical and cognitive performance.

To stay hydrated, aim to drink at least eight glasses of water a day. This requirement can vary depending on factors such as age, activity level, and climate. Consuming water-rich foods like fruits and vegetables also contributes to overall hydration.
